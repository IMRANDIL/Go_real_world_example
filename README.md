# Market Data PDF Generator

This project demonstrates how to fetch market data from a PostgreSQL database hosted on Aiven cloud, process the data using Go routines, and generate a PDF report from the fetched data. The market data is sourced from a CSV file downloaded from Kaggle, which is then converted to JSON format and loaded into the PostgreSQL database to simulate real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started
